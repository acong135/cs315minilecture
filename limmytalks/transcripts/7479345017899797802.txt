 Here are the colleges you get into with a 3.4 GPA and an 1110 SAT score. This student applied to UT Austin, Texas A&M, Baylor UT Dallas, University of Houston, Lamar University, University of North Texas, Sam Houston State, and SFA. If you can guess what state this guy is from, I'll give you a dollar. Guess what? He was accepted to every single one of those. As for the rest of his college application, well he took two APs, Chem and Calculus AB. He's Indian, second gen, comes from a middle income family. He was president of student council, NHS Treasurer, had placement in IT Services and IT Quiz Bowl, was a tech intern with his school district, had 40 plus dual enrollment hours, 10 plus first division medals in band, and was section leader. There you have it. Pretty solid application, and he's probably killing it at whatever university he decided to go to. He didn't indicate here yet.
