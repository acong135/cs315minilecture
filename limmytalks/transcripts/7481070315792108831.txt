 This college application is proof that you don't need insane extra-curriculars to get into a top university. This student got into Stanford with her main extra-curriculars being 3 years of varsity basketball, 3 years of varsity golf, 2 years of varsity badminton, 2 years of JV badminton. She did have a non-profit that generated 30k over 4 years, but nothing more specific than that. She also did have an online business that generated 3k a month, was part of speech and debate and was student body president. So with a little bit of hard work and dedication, most people can realistically accomplish things that are similar to these extra-curriculars. I will say that this student had a 4.8 weighted GPA, was ranked 2nd out of 315 kids in her class and had a 1590 SAT as well as a 35 on her ACT. As for the colleges that she got into, well Stanford is number 1. She was also accepted to UCLA, Columbia, Duke, UCSD and UCI. But very notably she was rejected from Cornell, rejected from Yale, Harvard, MIT, Berkeley and USC. So clearly some schools thought that she was a great fit with them, some schools didn't. But hey listen, it only takes one, remember?
