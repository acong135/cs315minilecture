 Talk about your story and that sort of thing. Yeah, absolutely. So my name is Alisa. I'm a sophomore at MIT studying computer science. So I was like into this application process three years ago, and I would love to be featured and like share my story with others because I think it's pretty interesting case. And yeah, it might be interesting perspective. How do we get right into it? What were your stats that got you into MIT? That's the thing. So just a bit of like a context. I'm Ukrainian and I got to the US three years ago, more like two years and a half after the war started. So I was in US in August, 2022, and I was applying to basically MIT and all of the colleges in like the fall 2022. So I didn't have absolutely like any time to prep for SAT or anything. So my SAT was 12AA, 760 on math or 770, something like this, 510 on English, which is like naturally something crazy if you look at the others as stats. So yeah, another stats, it's GPA. So another thing here, I got into MIT with no grades at all. I had only grades for my senior year of high school in the US just because I couldn't get my grades from my school in Ukraine. And the only thing that I had is two recommendation letters from my teachers in my high school in Ukraine that basically said that, oh, I was like straight A student, but I didn't have any proof of this. So the only thing is like recommendation letters, English. Well, English test was like 130 on Duolingo English test, which is like the minimum requirement for any college here in the US.
